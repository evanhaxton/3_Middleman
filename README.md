Testing
=======

This cookbook was developed utilizing test kitchen and Vagrant.  During each run,
the resulting server is deployed to VirtualBox.

To run the test, please be in the 1_MongoDB directory

A `.kitchen.yml` file is provided. Run `kitchen test` to verify this cookbook.

The kitchen test cycle is composed of the following steps:  

o `kitchen converge`.  This creates an instance of the deployed image

o `kitchen verify`.    This command verifies that the deployed instance is operating as expected.

o `kitchen destroy`.   Will remove the deployed instance


Optional commands:

o `kitchen login`      Will allow the user to connect to a deployed image
